/*
 * The algorithm is constructed to be as efficient as possible. That's
 * done by sacrificing the accuracy and giving possibly inexact answers
 * to questions asked by users. The main concepts and requirements are:
 *
 * 1. Small O(1) update time with only few conditions and cache line accesses;
 *
 * 2. Very fast O(1) calculation of several percentiles in parallel;
 *
 * 3. Very small overall memory footprint for inexpensive handling of
 *    performance trends of many servers;
 *
 * 4. Buckets must be dynamicaly rearranged since server response times
 *    are unknown apriori;
 *
 * 5. The adjustments of buckets must be performed in a lock-less fashion
 *    in a multi-core environment;
 *
 * 6. If a user asks for Nth percentile, e.g. 75th, an inaccurate value
 *    may be returned that is in fact for a different percentile, e.g.
 *    81st. That is very possible if there is insufficient data for an
 *    accurate percentiles calculation.
 */

/*
 * Response time statistics data structures.
 *
 * A time range is split into a number of buckets, such that each bucket
 * is efficiently calculated as @begin + (1 << @order).
 *
 * @order	- The order of a range. The ranges grow logarithmically.
 *		  Motivation: time estimation error becomes negligible as
 *		  the time grows, so higher response times may be estimated
 *		  with less accuracy;
 * @begin	- the start response time value of a range;
 * @end		- the end response time value of a range;
 * @atomic	- atomic control handler to update all control fields
 * 		  above atomically with a single write operation;
 * @tot_cnt	- global hits counter for all ranges;
 * @tot_val	- the sum of all response time values, for AVG calculation;
 * @min_val	- the minimum response time value;
 * @max_val	- the maximum response time value;
 * @cnt		- the number of hits with a specific response time that
 *		  fall to a specific bucket in a range.
 *
 * Keep the members cache line aligned to minimize false sharing: each range
 * is placed on a separate cache line, and control handlers are also on their
 * own cache lines.
