 * TODO: Currently seq_list is used only in requests. Responses are not
 * put in any queues, they are simply attached to requests as req->resp.
 * However, a queue for responses may also be needed to mitigate sending
 * of responses and improve the distribution of load in Tempesta. Please

 * suitable to stay in TfwHttpReq{} rather than here in TfwMsg{}.
