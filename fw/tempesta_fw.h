/**
 * Internally, Tempesta FW code is split into modules. These are not
 * necessarily kernel modules, but rather loosely coupled pieces of code.
 * Parsed configuration data and start/stop events need to be delivered
 * to the modules. The parser should not depend on all possible modules,
 * so a late binding approach is utilized here.
 *
 * Each module defines a TfwMod{} structure and calls tfw_mod_register().
 * A list of registered modules is maintained. Events and configuration
 * data are pushed to modules via callbacks.
 *
 * @name is a unique text identifier of the module. Just like C language
 * identifiers, it must consist of alphanumeric characters and start with
 * a letter and so on.
 *
 * @specs is the specification for the configuration parser. It lists
 * all possible configuration sections and directives for the module and
 * describes how to handle them. @specs must be an array of TfwCfgSpec{}
 * structures which is terminated by a null (zeroed) element.
 *
 * @start and @stop callbacks are invoked when corresponding events are
 * received via sysctl. The @start is called after the configuration is
 * parsed and all @specs are handled by modules.
 *
 * @cfgstart, @cfgend and @cfgclean are optional callbacks that are invoked
 * during configuration parsing. @cfgstart is called just before parsing if
 * additional initialization is required. @cfgend is called after
 * configuration was successfully parsed till the end. It's helpful for a
 * module, that require configuration information from other modules.
 * @cfgclean is called as the final step during configuration cleanup.
