 * Session/Presentation layer (in OSI terms) handling.
 *
 * An instance of TfwConn{} structure links each HTTP message to properties
 * of a connection the message has come on. Some messages may stay longer
 * in Tempesta after they're sent out to their destinations. Requests are
 * kept until a paired response comes. By the time the request's connection
 * is needed for sending the response, it may be destroyed already. Thus,
 * TfwConn{} instance is not destroyed along with the connection so that
 * it can be safely dereferenced. It's kept around until refcnt's value
 * permits freeing of the instance, so it may have longer lifetime than
 * the connection itself.
 *
 * @sk is an intrinsic property of TfwConn{}.
 * It has exactly the same lifetime as an instance of TfwConn{}.
 *
 * @peer is major property of TfwConn{}. An instance of @peer has longer
 * lifetime expectation than a connection. @peer is always valid while
 * it's referenced from an instance of TfwConn{}. That is supported by
 * a separate reference counter in @peer.
 *
 * These are the properties of a connection that are common to client
 * and server connections.
 *
 * @proto	- protocol handler. Base class, must be first;
 * @state	- connection processing state;
 * @list	- member in the list of connections with @peer;
 * @refcnt	- number of users of the connection structure instance;
 * @stream	- instance for control messages processing;
 * @timer	- The keep-alive/retry timer for the connection;
 * @peer	- TfwClient or TfwServer handler. Hop-by-hop peer;
 * @pair	- Paired TfwCliConn or TfwSrvConn for websocket connections;
 * @sk		- an appropriate sock handler;
 * @destructor	- called when a connection is destroyed;

/*
 * Queues in client and server connections provide support for correct
 * handling of requests and responses.
 *
 * Incoming requests are put on client connection's @seq_queue in the
 * order they come in. When responses to these requests come, they're
 * sent back to client in exactly the same order the requests came in.
 * @seq_queue is contended by threads that process requests, as well
 * as by threads that process responses. In the latter case that may
 * not lead to sending a response. Thus a separate @ret_qlock is used
 * for sending responses to decrease the time @seq_qlock is taken for.
 *
 * Unless serviced from cache, each request is forwarded to a server
 * over specific server connection. It's put on server connection's
 * @fwd_queue, and also on @nip_queue if it's non-idempotent. Requests
 * must be forwarded in the same order they're put on @fwd_queue, so
 * it must be done under the queue lock. Otherwise pairing of requests
 * to responses may get broken. When a response comes then the first
 * request is taken out of @fwd_queue, and that's the paired request.
 * There're two types of requests in @fwd_queue: those that were sent
 * out, and those that were not sent out yet. @msg_sent points at the
 * latest request that was sent out. That is helpful when repairing
 * a server connection that had gone bad.
 *
 * A request is in @seq_queue until it's deleted, and may also be in
 * @fwd_queue if it's forwarded to a server. @nip_queue supplements
 * @fwd_queue and may be considered as part of @fwd_queue for this
 * description. A response is never put on any queue. Instead, it's
 * attached to a paired request as @req->resp. A request is always
 * processed in the context of just one queue at any given moment.
 * That way NO locking hierarchy is involved. Please see the code.
