 *
 * HTTP2 stream scheduler which implements stream prioritization
 * accoring RFC 7540 5.3.
 *
 * There are two algorithm of stream prioritization which are described
 * in RFC 7540 5.3 and RFC 9218. RFC 7540 5.3 is deprecated, but we
 * implement our scheduler according to RFC 7540, because all modern
 * browsers use RFC 7540 for HTTP2 stream prioritization and use modern
 * RFC 9218 only for HTTP3.
 *
 * Before developing of our own HTTP streams scheduling logic, we analyzed
 * how other open source HTTP servers implement this.
 * Nginx not fully support RFC 7540. A frame is inserted into the sending list
 * according to the rank (the level in the priority tree) of the stream and
 * weight. But it does not correspond to the RFC: a server should not send data
 * for a stream which depends on other streams. Also the algorithm can lead to
 * O(n) complexity (linear scan) if each next frame has higher priority than
 * the previous one.
 * H20 uses an O(1) approach described as an Array of Queue. This is the very
 * fast scheduler but it has two main disadvantages - it consumes a lot of
 * memory and is not fair.
 * We take into accout that sharing bandwidth for sibling streams has sence
 * only for progressive JPEGs. Moreover all browsers expect Firefox use
 * exclusive flag so the priority tree degenerates into a list and resources
 * are requested sequentially. Progressive JPEGS (only for Firefox browser)
 * is a very rare case, so we decide to process requests from streams from
 * larger to smaller weight.
 * 
 * When we search for the most priority stream we iterate over the levels of
 * the priority tree. For exanple:
 *                     1 (256)
 *          3 (256)              5 (1)
 *     7 (256)   9 (1)    11 (256)     13 (1)
 *
 * In this example we have streams 3 and 5 which depend on  to stream 1,
 * streams 7 and 9 which depend on stream 3, and streams 11 and 13, which
 * depend on stream 5. We start from stream 1 and if it is active (has data
 * to send and not blocked by HTTP window exceeding) we return it. If is not
 * active but has active children we move to the next level of the tree
 * (streams 3 and 5) and choose the stream (which is active) with the greatest
 * weight.
