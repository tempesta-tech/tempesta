/**
 *		Tempesta FW
 *
 * Generic Finite State Machine (GFSM).
 *
 * GFSM is a replacement for traditional HTTP processing phases to build
 * arbitrary graph of traffic processing modules. The basic concept is that
 * there are number of processing FSMs, such as:
 *   - HTTP, TLS, ICAP, and other network protocol processing state machines;
 *   - security rules enforcement modules and traffic classifiers;
 *   - loadable TL programs;
 *   - user-space modules such as FastCGI or REST.
 *
 * The FSMs are essentially subroutines in sense of Knuth definition of
 * coroutines, i.e. a subroutine can:
 *   1. call other subroutine;
 *   2. yield control to other subroutine.
 *
 * GFSM is a voluntary (co-operative) data-driven scheduler for the subroutines.
 * While traditional preemptive (time-sharing) scheduler cares about fair time
 * slice sharing among processes, GFSM cares about processing hot (in sense of
 * CPU caches) data by all subroutines, who, and only who, are interested in
 * the data. I.e. when a packet arrives, all subroutines interested in
 * processing the packet are called immediately while the packet data resides
 * in CPU caches. A data is considered interesting for a subroutine if the
 * subroutine subscribed (hooked) for the states of other FSM or a network
 * packet reception (tfw_gfsm_dispatch()).
 *
 * Subroutines are registered in GFSM in order according to their priorities.
 * A subroutine registering as well as unregistering can be done in run-time
 * (crucial for TL loadable programs). A subroutine (especially security
 * enforcement) can stop current data processing by blocking return code, so
 * all subroutines with lower priorities won't see the data.
 *
 * GFSM example for simplified HTTP/ICAP interoperability:
 *   1. softirq1 receives HTTP request and calls GFSM to switch to ICAP FSM;
 *   2. ICAP FSM sends the request to ICAP server in the same softirq1.
 *      softirq1 forgets about the request and goes to process other packets.
 *      However, current HTTP FSM state must be saved, so it can continue to
 *      process the request later;
 *   3. softirq2 receives response from ICAP server and calls GFSM to switch
 *      to HTTP FSM back;
 *   4. HTTP continues to process the request: cache it, forward it to
 *      an upstream etc.
 *
 * Tempesta FW receives control on TCP socket callbacks, so GFSM subroutines
 * works at L4-L7. While L3 data is available for the subroutines, pure L3
 * logic should be processed using nftables and/or eBPF to get more
 * performance.
 *
 * GFSM stores FSM states in an array w/ free organisation to allow graph-like
 * FSM switching scheme. The entry point to GFSM is defined by current
 * connection type and the next GFSM transitions by registered FSM hooks for
 * currently running FSM.
 *
 * A subroutine yields it's control flow by moving to the next state using
 * tfw_gfsm_move().
