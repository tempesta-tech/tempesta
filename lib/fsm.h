/**

 *
 * Simple FSM routines use switch() together with direct jumps.
 * Unlike HTTP parser FSM using labels as values GCC extension to avoid
 * switch() completely, FSMs using the routines aren't supposed to handle
 * many states for small input data. Labels as values make FSM more complex
 * and make sense only if state lookup introduce significant overhead, e.g.
 * lookup a state for each input character as it is in HTTP parser.
