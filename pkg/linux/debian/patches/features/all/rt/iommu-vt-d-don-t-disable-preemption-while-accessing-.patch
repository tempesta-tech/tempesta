Subject: [PATCH] iommu/vt-d: don't disable preemption while accessing
 deferred_flush()
Origin: https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/4.8/older/patches-4.8.15-rt10.tar.xz

get_cpu() disables preemption and returns the current CPU number. The
CPU number is later only used once while retrieving the address of the
local's CPU deferred_flush pointer.
We can instead use raw_cpu_ptr() while we remain preemptible. The worst
thing that can happen is that flush_unmaps_timeout() is invoked multiple
times: once by taskA after seeing HIGH_WATER_MARK and then preempted to
another CPU and then by taskB which saw HIGH_WATER_MARK on the same CPU
as taskA. It is also likely that ->size got from HIGH_WATER_MARK to 0
right after its read because another CPU invoked flush_unmaps_timeout()
for this CPU.
The access to flush_data is protected by a spinlock so even if we get
migrated to another CPU or preempted - the data structure is protected.

While at it, I marked deferred_flush static since I can't find a
reference to it outside of this file.
