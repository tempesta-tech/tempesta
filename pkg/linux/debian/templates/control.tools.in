Architecture: linux-any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Section: libdevel
Description: USB device sharing system over IP network (development files)
 USB/IP is a system for sharing USB devices over the network.
 .
 This package provides headers for the libusbip library and
 the library itself for static linking.

Package: usbip
Build-Profiles: <!stage1 !pkg.linux.notools>
Architecture: linux-any
Depends: usbutils, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Section: admin
Description: USB device sharing system over IP network
 USB/IP is a system for sharing USB devices over the network.
 .
 To share USB devices between computers with their full
 functionality, USB/IP encapsulates "USB requests" into IP
 packets and transmits them between computers.
 .
 Original USB device drivers and applications can be used
 for remote USB devices without any modification of them. A
 computer can use remote USB devices as if they were
 directly attached.
 .
 Currently USB/IP provides no access control or encryption.
 It should only be used in trusted environments.
 .
 This package provides the server component 'usbipd' and the
 client tool 'usbip'.

Package: hyperv-daemons
Build-Profiles: <!stage1 !pkg.linux.notools>
Architecture: i386 amd64 x32
Depends: lsb-base, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Section: admin
Description: Support daemons for Linux running on Hyper-V
 Suite of daemons for Linux guests running on Hyper-V, consisting of
 hv_fcopy_daemon, hv_kvp_daemon and hv_vss_daemon.
 .
 hv_fcopy_daemon provides the file copy service, allowing the host to
 copy files into the guest.
 .
 hv_kvp_daemon provides the key-value pair (KVP) service, allowing the
 host to get and set the IP networking configuration of the guest.
 (This requires helper scripts which are not currently included.)
 .
 hv_vss_daemon provides the volume shadow copy service (VSS), allowing
 the host to freeze the guest filesystems while taking a snapshot.
