/**
 * Class for sending records to a Clickhouse database.
 *
 * Constructor:
 *    @TfwClickhouse - Initializes the Clickhouse connection and create a data
 *        block.
 *
 * Other public methods:
 *    @get_block - Returns a pointer to the data block for the specified CPU core.
 *    @commit - Commits the data in the block to the Clickhouse database if the
 *        blockâ€™s row count exceeds a maximum event threshold. After
 *        committing, the block is deleted, a new block is created via
 *        block_callback and last_time is updated. If a block was committed
 *        return true, otherwise return false.
 *    @handle_block_error() - try to recover from a Clickhouse API error or an
 *        access event parsing.
 *
 * Private Members:
 *    @client_ - Clickhouse Client instance for sending data to the database.
 *    @block_ - Block instance holding data records to be inserted.
 *    @table_name_ - Name of the Clickhouse table where data is inserted.
 *    @max_events_ - Maximum number of events to insert before committing.
