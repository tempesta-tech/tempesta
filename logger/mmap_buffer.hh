/**
 * Tempesta user space ring buffer reader
 * TfwMmapBufferReader is a reader from a ring buffer mapped into user space.
 * It monitors the buffer for new data. When new data is available, it invokes
 * a specified callback, providing a pointer to the start of the data, its size
 * and CPU number.
 *
 * Constructor:
 *    @TfwMmapBufferReader - Initializes own fields, maps the buffer.
 *
 * Destructor:
 *    @~TfwMmapBufferReader - Unmaps the buffer.
 *
 * Other public methods:
 *    @run - Main reading loop. Continuously checks if new data is available by
 *        polling the `is_ready` flag in the shared buffer and outer stop_flag.
 *        Calls `read()` to process data if available and notifies the callback.
 *    @get_cpu_id - Returns the CPU ID from the shared buffer.
 *
 * Private methods:
 *    @init_buffer_size - Retrieves the size of the ring buffer for proper data
 *        management and sets to the private size_ field.
 *    @read - checks if there is a new data block and executes the callback when
 *        new data is detected.
