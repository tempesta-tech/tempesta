# TAG: sched.
#
# Specifies the scheduler used to distribute the load among servers within
# a group.
#
# Syntax:
#   sched SCHED_NAME [OPTIONS];
#
# SCHED_NAME is a name of a scheduler module that distributes the load
# among servers within a group. There are two schedulers available:
#   - 'ratio' (default)
#       Balances the load across servers in a group based on each server's
#       weight. Requests are forwarded more to servers with more weight,
#       and less to servers with less weight. As a result, each server
#       in a group receives an optimal load. In default configuration
#       where weights are not specified, servers weights are considered equal,
#       and the scheduler works in pure round-robin fashion.
#   - 'hash'
#       Chooses a server based on a URI/Host hash of a request.
#       Requests are still distributed uniformly, but a request with the same
#       URI/Host is always sent to the same server.
#
# OPTIONS are optional. Not all schedulers have additional options.
#
# 'ratio' scheduler may have the following options:
#   - 'static'
#       The weight of each server in a group is defined statically
#       with [weight=<NN>] option of the 'server' directive. This is the
#       default Ratio scheduler option.
#   - 'dynamic'
#       The weight of each server in a group is defined dynamically.
#       Specific type of dynamic weight is specified with additional options:
#       - 'minimum' - The current minimum response time from a server;
#       - 'maximum' - The current maximum response time from a server;
#       - 'average' - The current average response time from a server;
#       - 'percentile [<NN>]' - The current response time from a server
#           that is within specified percentile. The percentile may be
#           one of 50, 75, 90, 95, 99. If none is given, then the default
#           percentile of 90 is used.
#       If a specific type of dynamic weight is not specified, then
#       the default type of 'average' is used.
#   - 'predict'
#       The weight of each server in a group is predicted dynamically
#       for a time in the future, based on server's behavior in the past.
#       Additional options include those that are defined for 'dynamic' weight,
#       as well as the following options:
#       - 'past' - Period of time (in seconds) to keep past response time
#           values from a server. The default value is 30 seconds.
#       - 'rate' - Rate (times per second) of retrieval of past response time
#           values. The default value is 20 times per second.
#       - 'ahead' - Period of time (in seconds) for which to make a prediction;
#           It can't be more than half of **past**. The default value is 15
#           seconds.
#
# Note that there's also the HTTP scheduler. It dispatches requests among
# server groups only. Round-robin or hash scheduler must be used to select
# a server within a group.
#
# A group can be either explicit, defined with 'srv_group' directive, or
# implicit. Only one 'sched' directive is allowed per group. A scheduler
# defined for the implicit group becomes the scheduler for an explicit
# group defined with 'srv_group' directive if the explicit group is missing
# the 'sched' directive.
#
# Default:
#   sched ratio;
#

# TAG: server.
#
# Specifies an IP address/port of a back-end HTTP server.
#
# Syntax:
#   server IPADDR[:PORT] [conns_n=N] [weight=N];
#
# IPADDR may be either IPv4 or IPv6 address, hostnames are not allowed.
# IPv6 address must be enclosed in square brackets (e.g. "[::0]" but not "::0").
# PORT defaults to 80 if not set.
#
# 'conns_n=N' is the number of parallel connections to the server.
# The N defaults to 32 if the option is not specified.
#
# 'weight=N' is the static weight of the server. The weight must be in
# the range of 1 to 100. If not specified, then the default weight of 50
# is used with the static ratio scheduler. Just the weight that differs
# from default value may be specified for convenience.
#
# Multiple back-end servers may be specified, for example:
#   server 10.1.0.1:80;
#   server [fc00::1]:80;
#
# Default:
#   None.
#

#
# TAG: nonidempotent
#
# Defines a request that is considered non-idempotent.
#
# Syntax:
#   nonidempotent <METHOD> <OP> <string>;
#
# <METHOD> is one of supported HTTP methods, such as GET, HEAD, POST, etc.
# <OP> is a string matching operator, one of 'eq', 'prefix', 'suffix', or '*'.
# <string> is a verbatim string matched against URL in a request.
#
# One or more of this directive may be specified. The directives apply to
# one or more locations, either specific or global (see 'location' directive).
#
# Example:
#    nonidempotent GET prefix "/users/";
#    nonidempotent POST prefix "/users/";

# TAG: server_connect_retries
#
# Defines the maximum number of attempts to reconnect with a server.
#
# Syntax:
#   server_connect_retries NUM;

# requests in the connection are re-scheduled to other servers and/or
# connections.
#
# Default:
#   server_connect_retries 10;
#

#
# TAG: server_forward_retries
#
# Defines the maximum number of attempts to re-forward a request to a server.

#
# Default:
#   server_queue_size 1000;
#

#
# TAG: grace_shutdown_time
#
# Defines the timeout in seconds for graceful server removing during
# reconfiguration.
#
# Syntax:
#   grace_shutdown_time 5;

# If a server is deleted from the configuration, but is still alive, then
# let all current sessions and requests to finish, but do not schedule new
# sessions/requests to the server.
#
# Default:
#   grace_shutdown_time 0;
#

# TAG: srv_group
#
# Groups multiple backend servers into a single unit of load balancing.
# All backend servers within a group are treated as interchangeable.
# The load is distributed evenly over all servers within a single group.
# If some server goes offline, other members of the group take its load.
#
# Syntax:
#   srv_group NAME {
#       server IPADDR[:PORT] [conns_n=N];
#       ...
#   }
#
# NAME is a unique identifier of the group that may be used to refer it later.
#
# IPADDR[:PORT] is the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the server (see: server).
# conns_n=N is the number of parallel connections to the server (see: server).
#
# Examples:
#   srv_group static_storage {
#       server 10.10.0.1:8080;
#       server 10.10.0.2:8080;
#       server [fc00::3]:8081 conns_n=1;
#       sched hash;
#   }
#
# Default:
#   There is a special group called "default". All 'server' entries defined
#   outside an 'srv_group' added to the default group implicitly.
#

# TAG: http_chain
#
# Block of HTTP content-based load balancing rules. List of such linked
# blocks (chains), that contain rules, represent HTTP table.
# The HTTP table is instructed to send HTTP requests to a virtual host
# based on the contents of an HTTP request field, such as URI, Host,
# headers, etc.
#
# Syntax:
#   http_chain {
#       [ FIELD [HDR_NAME] == (!=) ARG ] -> ACTION [ = VAL];
#       ...
#   }
#
# FIELD is an HTTP request field such as uri, host, etc.
# Supported FIELD keywords:
#   - 'uri'
#       Only a part of URI is looked at that contains the path and the query
#       string if any (e.g. "/abs/path.html?query&key=val#fragment").
#   - 'host'
#       The host part from URI in HTTP request line, or the value of Host
#       header field. The Host part in URI takes priority over the Host header
#       field value.
#   - 'method'
#       HTTP request method. Supported ARG values for this field are: "copy",
#       "delete", "get", "head", "lock", "mkcol", "move", "options", "patch",
#       "post", "propfind", "proppatch", "put", "trace", "unlock", "purge".
#   - 'hdr'
#       The content of specific HTTP header. In this case HDR_NAME field is
#       used to specify the name of header; the value of header should be
#       specified in ARG. Matching of special headers: "X-Forwarded-For",
#       "If-None-Match", "Referer", "Cookie", "User-Agent", "Content-Type",
#       "Connection", "Host" - is accelerated; processing of other headers
#       may be slow as it requires walking over all headers of an HTTP
#       request. Also, suffix OP is not supported for not special headers.
#   - 'mark'
#       The value of netfilter mark of request's skb.
#
# ARG is an argument (such as "/foo/bar.html", "example.com", etc.) for
# comparison with FIELD. The type of comparison for FIELD and ARG depends
# on "==" ("!=") sign and on wildcard existence in ARG:
#   "==": "ARG" => eq / "ARG*" => eq_prefix / "*ARG" => eq_suffix.
#   "!=": "ARG" => non_eq / "ARG*" => non_eq_prefix / "*ARG" => non_eq_suffix.
# Types of comparison operations:
#   - 'eq'              - FIELD is fully equal to the string specified in ARG.
#   - 'non_eq'          - FIELD is not equal to the string specified in ARG.
#   - 'eq_prefix'       - FIELD starts with the string specified in ARG.
#   - 'non_eq_prefix'   - FIELD doesn't starts with the string specified in ARG.
#   - 'eq_suffix'       - FIELD ends with the string specified in ARG.
#   - 'non_eq_suffix'   - FIELD doesn't ends with the string specified in ARG.
#
# ACTION is a rule action with appropriate type; possible types are:
#   - 'vhost' reference
#       Rule with such action pass the request to specified virtual host
#       (must be defined earlier in configuration file).
#   - 'chain' reference
#       Rule redirects request to other HTTP chain
#       (must be defined earlier and must not be the same as current).
#   - 'mark'
#       Rule sets netfilter marks into all skbs for all matched requests.
#   - 'block'
#       Rule blocks all matched requests.
#
# VAL is possible value for specified action; only 'mark' action is allowed to
# have value (unsigned integer type).
#
# Rule entry is a single instruction for HTTP table that says: take the FIELD
# of http request, compare it with ARG. If they match, then apply rule ACTION
# (with possible VAL) to that request.
# For every HTTP request, HTTP table executes all rule instructions in all
# linked HTTP chains (beginning from the main chain) sequentially until it finds
# a match. If no match is found, then the request is dropped.
#
# Default match rule can be specified. Its syntax looks like this:
#
# Syntax:
#     -> ACTION;
#
# This rule works as last resort option, and if specified it applies designated
# action to requests that didn't match any more specific rule. As all match
# rules are processed in sequential order, this rule must come last to serve
# the intended role.
# One main HTTP chain (without name) must be specified after all other chains in
# configuration file. If no main chain is specified, it is created implicitly.
# In this case one default match rule pointing to default virtual host will be
# created in implicit main chain if default virtual host is present in
# configuration and if such default rule (with default virtual host) have not
# been specified explicitly in any chain in configuration.
# User can explicitly create main HTTP chain with empty list of rules, which
# means the complete absence of rules - all incoming requests will be dropped
# in such configuration.
#
# Example:
#   srv_group static { ... }
#   srv_group nts_app { ... }
#   srv_group foo_app { ... }
#   srv_group bar_app { ... }
#   srv_group default { ... }

# Directive which is used in 'vhost' and 'location' blocks and specifies
# server groups to which requests for current vhost and/or location must
# be sent.
#
# Syntax:
#   proxy_pass GROUP [backup=BKP_GROUP];
#
# GROUP is the reference to a previously defined 'srv_group'.
#
# Optional parameter BKP_GROUP is the reference to a previously defined backup
# 'srv_group'. Requests will be sent to backup BKP_GROUP, if none of the
# servers in specified GROUP are available.
#
# Example:
#   proxy_pass heavy backup=bkp_grp;
#
# Default:
#   Directive proxy_pass is mandatory for 'vhost' and 'location' directive
#   blocks. For explicit default vhost directive (and included locations)
#   only proxy_pass directives with 'default' server groups is allowed to be
#   specified (or proxy_pass directive may be absent at all. In this case it
#   is created automatically). For implicit default vhost - proxy_pass directive
#   is not allowed (since default vhost must point to default server group).
#

# TAG: filter_db
#
# Path to a filter database file used as a storage for Tempesta FW filter rules.
# The same as cache_db.
#
# Default:
#   filter_db /opt/tempesta/db/filter.tdb;
#

# TAG: drop_tbl_size
#
# Size of filter drop table.
#
# Syntax:
#   filter_tbl_size SIZE
#
# Default:
#   filter_tbl_size 16777216;  # 16MB
#

# TAG: sticky
#
# Tempesta sticky cookie.
#
# Syntax:
#   sticky [name=<COOKIE_NAME>] [enforce] [max_misses=<LIMIT>] [timeout=<TMT>]
#
# Default:
#   Tempesta sticky cookie is not used.
#
# COOKIE_NAME is the name of Tempesta sticky cookie is used in HTTP
# requests that pass through Tempesta. When not specified explicitly,
# a default name is used.
#
# 'enforce' - enforce the use of Tempesta sticky cookie in all HTTP
# requests that come to Tempesta. If Tempesta sticky cookie is not
# found in an HTTP request, a client get an HTTP 302 response that
# redirects the client to the same URI, and prompts that Tempesta
# sticky cookie is set in the request.
#
# 'max_misses' - sets the maximum count of redirected requests (with no
# cookie or with incorrect cookie value). This option is applicable
# only if 'enforce' mode is enabled. If configured limit is exhausted,
# the corresponding client will be blocked. LIMIT is non-negative
# integer (default value is 0, which means that limit verification
# is disabled).
#
# 'timeout' - sets the maximum period between the first redirected
# request and successful cookie verification from certain client.
# This option is applicable only if 'enforce' mode is enabled and
# 'max_misses' parameter has value greater then zero. If configured
# timeout is expired, the corresponding client will be blocked.
# TMT is non-negative integer (default value is 0, which means that
# timeout tracking is disabled).
#
# NOTE: line breaks inside the directive are not allowed. See 'js_challenge'.
#
# Examples:
#   sticky;                         # Enable sticky cookie with default name.
#   sticky enforce;                 # Enforce sticky cookie with default name.
#   sticky name=__cookie__ enforce; # Enable sticky cookie with custom name.
#

# TAG: sticky_secret
#
# Secret string for sticky cookie.
#
# Syntax:
#   sticky_secret <string>
#
# This is secret (key) used for HMAC calculation for Sticky cookie value.
# It's desirable to keep this value in secret to prevent automatic cookies
# generation on attacker side. By default Tempesta generates a new random
# value for the secret on start. This means that all user HTTP sessions are
# invalidated on Tempesta restart. Maximum length of the key is 20 bytes.
#
# Example:
#   sticky_secret "f00)9eR59*_/22";
#
# Default:
#   Random bytes.
#

# TAG: sess_lifetime
#
# HTTP session life time in seconds. Zero value means unlimited life time.
# This option doesn't affect sticky cookie expire time - it's a session,
# temporal, cookie.
#
# Syntax:
#   sess_lifetime NUM;
#
# Example:
#   sess_lifetime 900;
#
# Default:
#   sess_lifetime 0;
#

# TAG: sticky_sessions
#
# Load balancing method. Forward all requests from client to the the same
# upstream server. Applied to a server group.
#
# Syntax:
#   sticky_sessions [allow_failover]
#
# First request to a server group in client's HTTP session will be forwarded
# to upstream server chosen by scheduler applied to the server group. All the
# following requests to that group in this session will pass through scheduler
# and will be forwarded to the same server. Client will receive 502 error
# if pinned upstream server went offline. Method can't be applied if client
# does not support cookies or Tempesta sticky cookie is disabled.
#
# Note: Session preservation is the priority for the method, so client will
# be served by backup server group even when primary group is back online.
#
# 'allow_failover' - Pin session to a new upstream server and print the warning
# if the last pinned server went offline instead of sending 502 error to client.
#
# Examples:
#   srv_group app {
#       server 10.10.0.1:8080;
#       server 10.10.0.2:8080;
#       server [fc00::3]:8081 conns_n=1;
#
#       sticky_sessions;
#   }
#
# Default:
#   Sticky sessions are disabled.

#
# 'delay_min'   - Minimal timeout to make a client wait.
# 'delay_range' - Allowed time period to receive and accept client's session.
# 'delay_limit' - Maximum difference between current jiffies value when a
#                 consequent request is received and a timestamp specified
#                 in the sticky cookie. Optional parameter.
# 'resp_code'   - Status code for response with JS challenge. Optional
#                 parameter, default is "503".
# <SCRIPT_TEMPLATE> - path to JS challenge script.. Optional parameter, default
#                 is "/etc/tempesta/js_challenge.conf".
# <TIME>        - time in usecs.
#
# NOTE: During start process 'tempesta.sh' uses 'grep' to update
# <SCRIPT_TEMPLATE> file with values described in 'js_challenge' directive, so
# line breaks are not allowed inside the directive.
#
# Example:
#   js_challenge resp_code=503 delay_min=1000 delay_range=1000 delay_limit=3000
